# Sliding-Tile-Puzzle
A programme written in Java to solve the 16 sliding tile puzzle

For code see MyQueue.java

Upon opening the BlueJ package compile the MyQueue class and run the class function new MyQueue().

Please note...

The tile puzzle must start at
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 #

with '#' being the empty tile

Due to the complexity of the calculation an alteration of more than 6 movements will begin to take an exponential amount of time longer for the programme to calculate.

Once changed enter the new positioning of the puzzle carefully, using '#' for the empty tile.
