# Sliding-Tile-Puzzle
A programme written in Java to solve the 16 sliding tile puzzle

ATTENTION - THE FILES MUST BE OPENED USING BLUEJ - ATTENTION

Upon opening the BlueJ package compile the MyQueue class and run the class function new MyQueue().
Follow the programme instructions to enter the values of each tile within the start and finish grid (either numbers 1-15 or the ‘#’ for the empty tile).
The programme will then run the search to find a path from the start grid to the desired grid.
